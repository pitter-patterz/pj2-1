# Introduction
This is the first task of *project 2*. We use Resnet-18 to do classfication on CIFAR-100 images, and implemenet three methods of data augmentation, including cutout, mixup and cutmix. The model is referred to https://github.com/samcw/ResNet18-Pytorch.

*model.py*: Define the structure of Resnet-18.

*data_augmentation.py*: Mixup and cutmix. Note that cutout is realised via transforms.RandomCrop().

*train.py*: Train a Resnet-18 within 10 epochs.

*test.py*: Test the accuracy of our trained net, while inspecting some misclassified images.

*record*: Loss and accuracy curves.

The four trained nets (with the optimal learning rate) can be downloaded from https://pan.baidu.com/ (pwdï¼šsjwl)

# Usage
For each of the four training modes (none, cutout, mixup and cutmix), we try three different learning rates 0.0007, 0.001 and 0.0012. Use commands to set the trainig mode.

+ python train.py none  (same as python train.py)
+ python train.py cutout
+ python train.py cutmix
+ python train.py mixup

Modify train.py if you're going to change the hyper parameters (LR,EPOCH and etc). Then we test the four models altogether.

+ python test.py
